# GitHub Actions Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The GitHub Actions workflow `sync-docs.yml` was failing because:
1. It was trying to copy files from `android/` directory to root, but the paths were incorrect
2. The actual documentation files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) exist in the root directory, not in android/
3. The workflow logic was backwards - it should sync FROM root TO android, not the other way

## What Was Fixed

### 1. sync-docs.yml Workflow
**Before:** Tried to copy from android/ to root (files didn't exist in android/)
**After:** Copies from root to android/ directory for consistency

**Key Changes:**
- Changed sync direction: Root → Android (not Android → Root)
- Added proper file existence checks
- Updated to `actions/checkout@v4` for latest features
- Added `permissions: contents: write` for proper access
- Fixed bot user configuration for commits
- Improved change detection logic

### 2. New android-ci.yml Workflow
Added a comprehensive CI workflow for Android builds:
- Automatic builds on push to master
- JDK 17 setup with Gradle caching
- Debug APK building
- Unit test execution
- Artifact uploads for APKs and test results

## File Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── sync-docs.yml     # Documentation synchronization (FIXED)
    └── android-ci.yml    # Android CI/CD pipeline (NEW)
```

## How It Works Now

### sync-docs.yml
1. Triggers on push to master when README.md or CHANGELOG.md change
2. Checks out the repository
3. Copies documentation from root to android/ directory
4. Only commits if files actually changed
5. Uses GitHub Actions bot for commits

### android-ci.yml
1. Triggers on Android code changes
2. Sets up Java environment
3. Builds debug APK
4. Runs unit tests
5. Uploads artifacts for download

## Benefits
- ✅ No more workflow failures
- ✅ Documentation stays synchronized
- ✅ Automated builds for every push
- ✅ Test results available as artifacts
- ✅ APKs automatically built and available for download

## Testing the Workflows

### Manual Trigger
Both workflows support `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering:
1. Go to Actions tab on GitHub
2. Select the workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

### Automatic Trigger
- `sync-docs.yml` - Edit README.md or CHANGELOG.md and push
- `android-ci.yml` - Make any change in android/ directory and push

## Troubleshooting

If workflows fail in the future:
1. Check the Actions tab on GitHub for error logs
2. Verify file paths are correct
3. Ensure proper permissions are set
4. Check that gradle wrapper has execute permissions

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
1. Release builds with signing
2. Automated version bumping
3. Play Store deployment
4. Code coverage reports
5. Lint checks
6. Security scanning
