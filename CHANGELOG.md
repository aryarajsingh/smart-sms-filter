## Version 1.1.0 - The Phoenix Update

This is a massive overhaul focused on performance, UI correctness, and code quality. The app should feel significantly faster, smoother, and more polished.

### Major Fixes & Improvements

*   **üöÄ Radical Scrolling Performance Boost**: Fixed the choppy scrolling in message lists. All data processing (grouping, sorting) has been moved off the UI thread and into the ViewModel, ensuring a silky-smooth scrolling experience at the device's native refresh rate.
*   **üé® Theming Overhaul (Light & Dark Mode)**: Systematically fixed all UI glitches, especially in light mode. Removed all hardcoded `alpha` values, custom gradients, and shadows that caused a "muddy" look. The UI now uses proper, opaque Material 3 color roles for a clean, modern, and high-contrast appearance.
*   **üêû Spam Counter Fixed**: The spam message counter now updates instantly and accurately when messages are moved to or from the spam folder.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Stronger Spam Classification**: The spam filter is now more aggressive and accurate.
    *   **Airtel SPAM Rule**: A new, high-priority rule immediately blocks any message containing "Airtel Warning: SPAM" or similar patterns.

### Minor Fixes

*   **Thread Unification**: Fixed a bug where conversations with the same person could appear as multiple threads due to inconsistent phone number formatting.
*   **Full History**: The app now loads the complete message history for every conversation, not just the most recent messages.
*   **Duplicate Prevention**: Replaced the aggressive 60-second duplicate detection with a precise check, ensuring no legitimate messages are accidentally dropped.

### Code Quality & Housekeeping

*   **Full Codebase Audit**: Every single line of code was read and analyzed.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added clear KDoc comments to all major classes and functions across the data, domain, and presentation layers.
*   **Security**: Audited all user input points and data handling pathways.
